# Favourite thing I wrote. 
## A short story to empower climate action
Hi! Iâ€™m Laynol and my favourite thing I wrote was a fictional short story for a class on forest ecosystems. I was tasked with writing a short story that would inspire others to take part in climate action. I thoroughly enjoyed this assignment as it was a unique kind of assessment that I was not expecting in this kind of course. I had a pleasant time writing this short story because it allowed me to make use of my imaginative skills which were skills I felt I was not exercising at the time. 

To my surprise, I received a great grade on my short story. The professor even suggested that I enter it into a short story contest that happened to be centered around the theme of climate change. Additionally, I received my grade for the assignment just before exam season had started which felt like standing in a ray of sunshine during a dark storm.
